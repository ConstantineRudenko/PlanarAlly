2022.1.0

For server owners using a subpath, some important changes are made, so make sure to check the changed section before upgrading

### Added

-   simple logic systems to attach to shapes
    -   these logic systems can be configured with permissions
    -   current set of logic systems:
        -   door
            -   Automatically toggle blocking settings for a shape with a single click
        -   teleport zones
            -   Automatically move shapes to spawn points
-   Dropping an asset with dimension info in its name (e.g. 50x30) will automatically size the asset
-   [asset-manager] drop support for folders
-   [server] Added `allow_signups` option in the `General` config section that can be disabled to prevent users from signing up themselves
-   [server] Added barebones admin dashboard
    -   this uses the API endpoint and requires a token
    -   lists users + reset password + delete
    -   lists campaigns
-   container (Docker) build instructions for arm64

### Changed

-   Draw tool UI now has a tabbed interface
    -   a shape tab to configure shape and colours
    -   a visibility tab to configure advanced vision modes as well as blocksVision and blocksMovement changes
-   Polygon edit tool will hide UI while dragging a point/shape
-   [server] Change subpath handling
    -   the client now MUST also set the PA_BASEPATH env variable in production mode
    -   this means the env variable needs to be set at build time
    -   the basepath now HAS TO END with a slash
    -   for docker this means you need to manually build the image
        -   use `--build-arg PA_BASEPATH='/subpath/'
        -   you no longer need the `--env PA_BASEPATH` flag

### Fixed

-   Floor not being remembered on reload after "Bring Players" action
-   Shape pasting not properly increasing badge counters
-   Default vision shapes always acting as tokens (regardless of isToken)
-   Map tool aspect ratio lock no longer working
-   Modals will now change location when resizing the window would put them out of the visible screen area
-   Fix scroll bars being visible due to dice canvas not being sized strictly
-   Fix movement blockers intersecting with themselves when moving on the token layer
-   Fix assets becoming invisible when using a subpath setup (only applies to new assets)
-   Fix colour picker not allowing to change the rgba/hsla/hex values manually
-   Account removal not properly redirecting to login
-   Selecting a shape that was drawn in reveal mode no longer removes shadow during selection
-   Removing an asset would remove any campaign using it as their logo
-   Aura direction number input not synching change to server
-   Some memory leaks when changing locations
-   Floor lighting behaviour for late loading images
-   DDraft uploads not progressing in the asset manager
-   DDraft lights not properly being configured
-   [asset-manager] Asset manager would not check for stale files when removing a folder

### Performance

-   Cache Shape.points to prevent frequent recalculations
