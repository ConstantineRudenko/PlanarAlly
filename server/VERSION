2024.1

### Added

-   New location grid setting: drop ratio
    -   This is used to indicate how shapes with size info dropped on the map should be resized
    -   (e.g. a goblin_2x2 will take op 2x2 cells in any setup with dropRatio 1, with dropRatio 0.5 however it would only take up 1x1)
    -   This addresses an issue where this was not properly working with non ft setups
-   Selection Box UI now offers a 'clear' and 'select all' option if it's a multi-select popup

### Changed

-   Vision blocking shapes will now ignore themselves if they are closed
    -   e.g. a tree trunk will be visible, but what's behind the tree trunk will remain hidden
    -   Open polygons will behave as they have in the past
-   Note system is overhauled
    -   notes can now either be global or local (i.e. campaign specific)
    -   notes can now be shared with other players
    -   notes are now accessed through a special note manager
        -   this provides filtering / creation / editing / ...
    -   multiple notes can be popped out at once
    -   popout notes can be collapsed and freely resized
    -   popout notes are now markdown aware
    -   If the text area of a note is still in focus after 5 seconds and an edit was made, a server save is done
    -   _see the release notes for all the changes_
-   Dice history now contains user and details
-   Selection Info: auras are now toggle and rotation sliders instead of range modifiers
-   [tech] ModalStack now supports dynamically inserted modals

### Fixed

-   Polygon edit UI: was not taking rotation of shape into account
-   Teleport: shapes would not be removed on the old location until a refresh
-   Dice tool: would not send zero results when dice list is empty
-   Character: a collection of bugs with variants have been fixed
-   Trackers: add max-height and scrolling
-   RotationSlider: fix sync issues
-   RotationSlider: fix slider anchor not sticking to the rail under certain angles
-   [server] log spam of "unknown" shape when temporary shapes are moved
