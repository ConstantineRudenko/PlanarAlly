2023.3.0

### Added

-   Character concept
    -   A shape can be marked as a character
    -   Characters can be dropped anywhere (by the DM), moving/teleporting the shape to the new location
    -   This fills in a niche adjacent to the "Templates" concept
        -   Templates allow configuration of common data before placement, allowing unique modification afterwards
            (e.g. useful for prefilling monster info)
        -   Characters are a specific instance that remember their modifications (e.g. useful for (N)PCs)
-   Sort campaign listing by recent play or alphabetically
    -   Defaults to recent sort

### Changed

-   Assets removed in the asset manager will not remove the image on disk if there are still shapes depending on it
-   Shape removal will now also remove the related image on disk if there are no other assets/shapes depending on it
-   Circles used for shadows no longer use a square bounding box, but instead use a polygon approximating the circle.

### Fixed

-   Export: Campaigns with notes could fail to export
-   Vision: Edgecase in triangulation build
-   Kicking: The check to prevent the co-DM from kicking the main DM was incorrect
-   Shapes: The angle of shapes while rotating was being rounded to whole integers, which is kinda awkard when dealing with radians
-   Lighting: auras with both value and dim value set to 0 no longer light up the entire map
