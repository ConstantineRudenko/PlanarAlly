### Fixed

-   Group: No longer sending group info for each member (just once)
-   Group: Shape group settings fixes
    -   Create group button was not properly behaving
    -   Remove group button was not immediately updating the UI until a reselection

-   Auth: A logic error in the auth routing code - in some cases you had to manually go to the login page
-   Templates: Missing some settings when saved
-   Fake Player: Proper rework of access handling
    -   Shapes and auras should now only be rendered _if and only if_ some player in the game has `vision` access to that shape _AND_ the shape is selected in the vision tool.
    -   This also hides invisible shapes
    -   This also hides _all_ auras on the DM layer regardless of the vision tool
-   Labels: Fix removal not working
-   Toolbar: Fix vision and filter tools not immediately being available when relevant
-   Access: Fix players with specific access rules, having edit access at all times
-   Access: Changing access would not live update the edit shape UI if it was open by another client
-   Access: Fix default access in UI not being up to date if shape has no access modifications until reload
-   Access: Prevent DMs from having an explicit access rule
-   Access: No longer gives full access for fake DM
-   TpZone: Fix tp zone moving a player to a different floor not moving their view along (if 'move players' configured)
-   TpZone: Fix non-immediate player initiated teleports not working correctly
-   TpZone: Fix teleports initiated in build-mode not working correctly for players
-   Logic: Request mode not working as intended and behaving as Enabled mode instead
-   Token Directions: Fix shown tokens not taking filtered tokens into account
-   Auras: Fix sometimes not being visible until a refresh or panning closer to the aura
-   Rendering: Transparency of higher layers was no longer applied after a window resize
-   Rendering: Some cases where vision access related changes would not rerender immediately
-   Rendering: Grid not rendering horizontal lines when the width is smaller than the height of the screen
-   Select: Rotation UI should stay consistent when zooming
-   LocationBar: Fix width on drag handle for multiline locations
-   Properties: Invisible toggle not applying until a refresh for players
-   Initiative: Vision lock not properly checking active tokens
